### Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

- The **Input/Output Library** is a part of the C++ standard library dealing with basic input and output
    - The use it have `#include <iostream>` at the top of your file

- To print to the console use `std::cout << x;`
    - The **Insertion Operator** `<<` places the value in the stream
    - You can also concatenate with multiple insertion operators
    - e.g `std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";`
    - std::cout will never make a new line, in order to make a new line, use the insert operator to add either `\n` or (preferably) `std:endl`
    - e.g `std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;`
