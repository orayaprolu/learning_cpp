### Whitespace and basic formatting

- Some language elements must be white space seperated
    - e.g `int x;` this needs to be white space seperated for the compiler to differentiate the data type and the identifier
    - or even `int main()` to differentiate the return type and function identifier
    - When whitespace is required the compiler doesn't care how much you use

- In some cases newlines are used as seperators
    - for example if you try and write a single line comment in multiple lines that won't work
    ``` 
    // All of this stuff is commented
    but this stuff isn't and will cause an error
    ```
    - preprocessor directives (e.g. #include \<iostream\>) must be placed on separate lines

- Quoted text separated by nothing but whitespace will be concatenated
```
std::cout << "Hello "
     "world!"; // prints "Hello world!"
```

- Other than the cases mentioned above C++ doesn't really care about whitespace but of course you should properly format your code for human readability
