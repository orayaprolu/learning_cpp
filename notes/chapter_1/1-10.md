### Introduction to expressions

- An **Expression** is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls to calculate a value
    - The process of executing an expression is called **Evaluation**
        - During this process, each expression is combined (using the compiler's order of operations) until a single value remains
    - The result of a expression is called the **Return Value**
    - They do not end in semicolon and can't be compiled by themselves

- In C++ the result of an expression is on of the following:
    - a value (most common)
    - an object or function
    - Nothing, sometime we only care about the side-effect (such as variable assignment or a function call)

- An **Expression Statement** is an expression followed by a semicolon
    - When an expression is used in an expression statment the result is thrown away
        - This is fine though because we only care about the side effect
        - e.g in `x = 5;` the return value of `operator=` is thrown away, which is fine since because we just wanted to assign `x` to 5
    - Technically we could have an expression statement like `2 * 3;`, but since we arent passing the value, assigning it to a variable, etc... it doesn't do anything

- Note there is a difference between an expression statment and a statement with an expression in it
    - The term expression statement doesn't include stuff like variable declaration/initialization
    - e.g `int x = 10 + 6;` is a statement with an expression in it while `x = 10 + 6;` is an expression statement

- A **Subexpression** is an expression used as a operand
    - e.g in `x = (100 + 50) * (4)` both `(100 + 50)` and `(4)` are subexpressions since they are both operands

- A **Full Expression** is simply an expression that isn't a subexpression  
    - e.g `2`, `2 + 3`, and `x = 4 + 5` are all full expressions as long as they aren't used as an operand in another expression

- A **Compound Expression** is an expression that uses two or more operators
    - e.g in `x = 4 + 5` we use both `operator=` and `operator+`
