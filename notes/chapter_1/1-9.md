### Introduction to literals and operators

- A **Literal** is a constant value that is directly inserted into the source code
    - This is compared to Variables and Objects which are memory locations that hold values

- An **Operation** takes in inputs called **Operands** and produces an output
    - The action that transforms the inputs is denoted by a symbol called an **Operator**
        - Most operators have symbols, e.g +, -, /, *, ==, =, <<, >>, etc...
        - Some operators are just keywords e.g. new, delete, throw, etc... 
    - For operators that are symbols it is common to append the word "operator" before the symbol (We'll discuss this is more detail later)
        - e.g `x = 2 + 3` is the same as `x = 2 operator+ 3`

- The operator's **Arity** is the number of inputs it takes
    - **Unary** operators take 1 operand, e.g `-x`, the dash just flips the sign
    - **Binary** operators take 2 operands e.g `x + y` or `std::cout << 10`
    - **Ternary** operators take 3 operands
    - **Nullary** operators take no operands
    - Some operators change meaning based on the number of operands you give them
        - the dash can be either minus (w/ 2 operands) or flip sign (w/ 1 operand)

- A **Side Effect** of an operation is anything that changes due to an operation that isn't returned
    - Although side effect sounds unintentional, in programming we often intentionally use side effects
    - e.g in `x = 5` the assignment of the value 5 to the `x` variable is a side effect
        - The actual value returned isn't very useful, only the side effect is
