### Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

- The **Input/Output Library** is a part of the C++ standard library dealing with basic input and output
    - The use it have `#include <iostream>` at the top of your file

- To print to the console use `std::cout << x;`
    - The **Insertion Operator** `<<` places the value in the stream
    - You can also concatenate with multiple insertion operators
    - e.g `std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";`

- std::cout won't make a new line, in order to make a new line, use the insert operator to add either `\n` or `std:endl`
    - e.g `std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;`
    - std::cout is **Buffered** meaning inputs sent to cout get stored in memory and eventually at the end of the statement gets sent to the terminal
        - An unbuffered output would just immediately send the input to the output without waiting for more inputs

- The difference between `std::endl` and `\n` is that `std::endl` flushes the buffer, while `\n` doesn't
    - **Flushing** a buffer means emptying it out of memory and outputting (wherever that may be, the terminal for example in cout)
    - When outputting to the console we don't need to flush the buffer ourselves as C++'s output system does so automatically in a simpler and more efficient way than we do with 'std::endl'
    ```
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // single quoted (by itself) (conventional)
    std::cout << "Yep." << "\n";                 // double quoted (by itself) (unconventional but okay)
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n";     // between double quotes in existing text (conventional)
    return 0;
    ```

- To input from keyboard use `std::cin` with the **Extraction Operator** `>>` to put the input data into a variable until the user types enter
    - e.g 
    ```
    int x{};       // define variable x to hold user input (and value-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n'; 
    ```

    - You can take multiple inputs at once as long as they are whitespace seperated
    - e.g 
    ```
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers separated by a space: ";

    int x{}; // define variable x to hold user input (and value-initialize it)
    int y{}; // define variable y to hold user input (and value-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x >> y; // get two numbers and store in variable x and y respectively

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << " and " << y << '\n';
    ```

    - `std::cin` is buffered too
        - Individual characters you input are added to the input buffer and enter adds a `\n` to the buffer
        - Then the extraction operator removes characters in the front of the input buffer, converts those characters into a value, then finally using copy-assignment, assigns the value to the character
        - If there is ever an invalid character in the input, stops, converts whatever value is already in the buffer and continues leaving that invalid character in the buffer
        - e.g 
        ```
        std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
        int x{};
        std::cin >> x; // User enters "20a76"
        std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n'; // Will print out 20, a76 will remain in the input buffer

        int y{} 
        std::cin >> y; // Won't even prompt user since first character in input stream is invalid to fit in an integer, a76 will remain in the input buffer
        ```
