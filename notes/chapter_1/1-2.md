### Comments

- A **Comment** a programmer readable note that is directly in your source code but ignored by the compiler
    - In C++ we can either have single line or multi line commments

- **Single-Line Comments** tell the compiler to ignore everything from _//_ to the end of the line
    - e.g 
    `\\ Everything I wrote from here on is a comment`

- **Multi-Line Comments** tell the compiler to ignore evetyhing between _/*_ and _*/_
    - e.g 
    ```
    /* All this code will be commented
    no matter how long you keep
    writing for
    until you do */
    ```
