### Variable assignment and initialization

- **Variable Assignment** is when you give a variable _(that already exists!)_ a value using `=` which is called the **Assignment Operator**
    - By default, the assignment copies the value on the right of the operator to the variable on the left aptly named **Copy-Assignment**
    - e.g
    ```
    int current_year;
    current_year = 2025; 
    std::cout << current_year; // Prints 2025
    ```


- **Variable Initialization** is when your provide an optional initial value for your object when declaring it
    - C++ contains many different forms of initialization with these being the most common:
    ```
    int a;         // default-initialization (no initializer)

    // Traditional initialization forms:
    int b = 5;     // copy-initialization (initial value after equals sign)
    int c ( 6 );   // direct-initialization (initial value in parenthesis)

    // Modern initialization forms (preferred):
    int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
    int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces)
    ```    
- **Copy-Initialization** works similiarly to copy-assignment where the value on the right is coped to the variable on the left
    - It has fallen out of favor in modern C++ due to being less efficient (Note. C++17 has fixed most of these issues)

- **Direct-Initialization** is when you put parentheses after the identifier of the variable and the value inside
    - It was initially added for more efficient initialization of complex objects like classes but has fallen out of favor to direct Direct-List-Initialization

- **List-Initialization** is a modern way to initialize objects using curly braces that has unambiguous syntax and behaves consistently
    - Before C++11 some types of initialization required copy-initialization while other required direct-initialization. Also, copy-initialization was too similiar to copy-assignment and direct-initialization was too similiar to function relation operations
    - It comes in two forms 
    ```
    int width { 5 };    // direct-list-initialization of initial value 5 into variable width (preferred)
    int height = { 6 }; // copy-list-initialization of initial value 6 into variable height (rarely used)
    ```
    - List-Initialization also is much stricter and disallows narrow conversions
    - A **Narrow Conversion** is when you convert a value of one type to a value of another type that is a smaller size e.g double to int
    ```
    int x = 18.4; // Compiles and just drops .4
    int y ( 18.4 ); // Compiles and just drops .4
    int z { 18.4 }; // Throws compilation error

- **Default-Initialization** is when you don't do anything and get not initialize the variable
    - This just leaves whatever was in that chunk of memory before to take that variable's value
    - Not ever recommended as it can leave to unpredictable outcomes (The worst errors to debug!)
    `int x; // default-initialization`

- **Value-Initialization** is when you initialize a variable with an empty set of curly braces 
    - This will implicitly set the object to it's default value
    - **Zero-Initialization** is just the case where the objects default value is 0
    ` int width {}; // value-initialization / zero-initialization to value 0 `

- **Instantiation** is the term used for a variable that an been created and initialized
    - An instantiated object is called an **Instance**

- If you initialize a variable but don't ever use it your compiler will give you an error
    - If you want to ignore this post C++17 use the `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute to let the compiler know not to worry
    - If you are using an older version, you can simply use the variable elsewhere like in a std::cout statement
    ```
    int main() . {
        [[maybe_unused]] int x { 100 }; // Only works post C++17
        int y = { 200 };
        std::cout << y; // Using the variable in a std::cout statement so compiler won't whine

        return 0
    }
    ```
