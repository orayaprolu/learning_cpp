### Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior

- An **Uninitialized Variable** is a variable that hasn't been given a value either through initialization or assignment
    - If you try and use one of them you'll get a random garbage value from whatever was there earlier
    - Using the values of uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected results

- **Undefined Behavior** is when your code producing different results every time it's run
    - More formally its _the result of executing code whose behavior is not well-defined by the C++ language._

- An **Implementation** of a programming language is a specfic compiler and it's associated standard library
    - **Implementation-Defined Behavior** is behavior defined by the implementation and must be documented and consistent for a given implementation
    - **Unspecified Behavior** is identical to implementation-defined behavior except its not required to be documented
    - In general we should try and avoid either of these
