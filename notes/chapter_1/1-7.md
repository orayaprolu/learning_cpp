### Keywords and naming identifiers

- A **Keyword** is a unique word that has special meaning in a programming languages
    - Variable identifiers cannot be named the same as any keywords in the language
    - C++ has 92 keywords
    - C++ also has special identifiers: _override, final, import, and module_ which only have special meaning in certain contexts

- Identifier naming rules in C++:
    - They cannot be a keyword (as mentioned earlier)
    - They can only be made from letters, numbers, and underscore (_)
    - They cannot start with a number, a letter or underscore is fine though

- It is conventional that C++ variables and functions start in a lowercase variable `int val // conventional`
- Identifiers that start with a capital letter are typically used for user-defined types
- You can use either snake_case or camelCase, snake_case seems a bit more popular but both are valid
- Avoid naming your identifiers starting with an underscore, these names are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use
