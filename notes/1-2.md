### Comments

- A **Comment** a programmer readable note that is directly in your source code but ignored by the compiler
    - In C++ we can either have single line or multi line commments

- **Single Line Comments** tells the compiler to ignore everything from _//_ to the end of the line
    - e.g 
'''
asdsa
'''
