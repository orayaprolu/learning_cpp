### Introduction to functions

- A **Function** is a reusable sequence of statements
    - **User-Defined Functions** are functions you write yourself
    - A **Function Call** tell the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function
        - When finished it returns to the point it left off at and resumes execution from there
    
- The function initiating the function call is called the **Caller**
    - The **Callee** is the function being called
    - A Function call is sometimes called an **Invocation** with the calller the **Invoking** the callee


##### Basic syntax:
```
returnType functionName() // This is the function header (tells the compiler about the existence of the function)
{
    // This is the function body (tells the compiler what the function does)
}
```

- the 1st line is called a **Function Header** and it tell us about the exsistence of a function, its name, return type, parameter list , and any access specifiers
