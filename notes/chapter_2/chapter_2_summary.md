### Notes on everything I didn't know in chapter 2

- Nested functions are not supported
- A value-returning function that does not return a value will produce undefined behavior
- An **Unnamed Parameter** is a parameter that doesn't have a identifier
  - It is for when a function might need to take a parameter
    - Why? For example if we have a function that takes a parameter, ship that code and later find an optimization that doesn't need that parameter, we can just make the parameter unnamed so internally we know the parameter isn't necesarry but externally it keeps backwards compatibility.
    - Other cases too operator++ & operator-- (discussed in chapter 21), when you only need to know the type of the input while overloading a function, etc...

- Variables are destroyed in reverse order of creation at the end of the set of curly braces they are defined in

- Scope is a compile time property, meaning it is enforced during compile time

-**Temporary Objects** aka **Anonymous Objects** are objects that have no scope and are destroyded before the next statement begins e.g.

  `std::cout << getValueFromUser() <<'\n'`
  - Since getValueFromUser isn't stored in any variable it is held in a temporary unnamed object till the statment is over

## 2.7
- A **Function Signature** is a description of the function's interface which include function name, and parameter types e.g add(int, int)

- A **Function Declaration** or **Function Prototype** is a complete declaration of the function which includes: function name, parameter types, return type, and (optionally) parameter names with a semicolon as it is a statement e.g int add(int a, int b);

- cpp compiles sequentially
  - functions must be defined before use or you must include a **Forward Declaration**, this is done by putting the function declaration with a seimicolon at the end above wherever it's called.
    - We often put these in header files !
    - important to tell the compiler about the existence of functions in other files`
    - Will get a linker error if you forward declare and call a func but don't actually provide a function body

- A **Declaration** tells the compiler of the existence of an indentifie like int add(int x, int y)

- A **Definition** is a declaration that actually implements (for functions and types) or instantiates for (for variables) the identifier
  - int x; would be a definition as it is declared and instantiated
q
- Declarations that aren't definitions are called **Pure Declarations**

- The **One Definition Rule** states:
  1. Within a file, each functions, variable, type, or template in a given scope can only have on definition
  2. Within a program, each function or variable in a given scope can only have one Definition. This rule exists because we can have more than 1 file in a program. Functions and vars not visible to linker are excluded from this rule.
  3. Types, templates, inline functions, and inline variables are allowed to have duplicate definitions in different files. Explained more later

- Overloaded functions count as distinct functions and thus different definitions.

## 2.8
- compiler compiles each file independentaly, one file doesn't know contents of others unless specified
  - This limited visibility is intentional since: it allows source files to be compiled in any order, when we change a source file only that file needs to be recompiled, and it reduces the possibility of naming conflicts

- if you have a main.cpp and a add.cpp you can use add in main as long as you have a forward declaration in main and compile both files such as `g++ main.cpp add.cpp -o main`

- This is how hpp files work! Notice how hpp files don't include their corresponding cpp file, but the cpp file has to include the hpp file since it's treated like a forward declaration

## 2.9
- A **Scope Region** is an area of the source code where all the declared identifiers are considered distinct from names declared in other scopes.
  - The body of a function is an example of this, two identically named identifiers can exists in two different function bodies no problem

- A **Namescape** provides another type of scope region named **Namescape Scope** that allows you to declare and define names inside purely for disambiguation, primarly to get around rule 2 in the one definition rule.
  - A namespace may only contain declarations and definitions, executable statements are only allowed as part of a definitions
  - used to group related identifiers in large projects to avoid naming collisions

- In cpp, any name not defined in a class, function, or namespace is automatically part of the implicitly-defined **Global Namespace** aka **Global Scope**
  - identifiers declared in global scope are in scope from the point of declaration to the end of files
  - We should avoid defining variabes in global scope (explained more in chapter 7.8)

- the std namespace was originally designed to just be part of the global namespace but would've caused confusion with naming conflicts from user defined identifiers in the global namespace

- When using code in a namespace we must tell the compiler with the **Scope Resolution Operator (::)** by puting namespace:: before the identifier, e.g std::cout. This is best practice

- We can use the **Using Directive** to acces names in a namepsace without using the namespace prefix
  - however is poor practice because for example if we are `using namespace std` this means that ANY identifier that we defined may conflict with any identically identifier in std, killing the whole purpose of namespaces

- Curly braces are often used to delineate a scope region nested within another scope region. For example a function defined in the global scope uses curly braces to seperate the scope region of the function to the global scope

```
void foo(int x) //foo is defined in the global score, x is defined within scope of foo()
{ //braces used to delineate nested scoped region for foo()
  std::cout << x;
} //x goes out of scope here
```

##  2.10
- Prior to compilation cpp files go through a **Preprocessing** phase. A programmed called the **Preprocessor** makes various changes to the text of the code file.
  - It doesn't actually modify the original code files but rather temporarily in memory
  - Historically preprocessors used to be seperate from compilers
  - It mostly just does uninteresting things like stripping out comments but it has one important role which is processing directives such as #include

- When a preprocessor is done processing the result is a **Translation Unit** which is what is compiled by the compiler.
  - Think of it as a single cpp file plus all the code pulled in by the includes and all macros

- The entire process of preprocessing, compiling, and linking is called **Translation**

- **Preprocessor Directives** aka **Directives** are instructions that start with # symbol and end with a new line (NOT a semicolon). They tell the preprocessor to perform certain text manipulation tasks.
  - proprocessor doesn't understand c++ syntax, directives have their own syntax

- Note: the using-directive statement is NOT a preprocessor directive. So while the term directive usually means a preprocessor directive, this is not always the case.

- When you #include a file, the preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the included files
  - Include is almost exclusively used with header files

- The #define directive can be used to create a macros. A **Macro** is a rule that defines how input text is converted to output text
  - There are two basic types of macros: object-like macros and function like macros
  - Function like macros act like functions and are useless in modern C++

- Object-like macros can be defined in one of two ways, by convention macro names are all uppercase, seperated by underscores.
```
#define INDENTIFIER
or
#define INDENTIFIER substitution_text
```

- Object-like macros with substitution text is kinda just like a global variable, not recommended in modern C++ since it is not type safe and is just text
  - They used to be used in C to assign names to literals
```
#include <iostream>
#define MY_NAME "Ojas"

int main() {
  std::cout << MY_NAME; //Just prints Ojas
}
```

- Object-like macros without substitution text replaces occurences of the identifier with nothing.
  - Mainly used for conditional compilation

- The **Conditional Compilation** preprocessor directive allows you to specify when something will and won't compile. There are a lot of condition compilation directives but the most used ones are #indef, #ifndef, #endif, and #if 0.
  - This is great for debugging, platform specific code, dev/test code, etc...

- #indef checks if an identifier has been defined via #define, if so the code between #ifdef and the matching #endif is compiled
```
#include <iostream>
#define PRINT_OJAS

int main() {
#ifdef PRINT_OJAS //If PRINT_OJAS is defined executes code till #endif
  std::cout << "OJAS\n;
#endif
  return 0;
}
```

- #if 0 means to not compile code between it and the matching #endif. Is a convient way to comment out code. You can temporarily re-enable the that block of code by changing 0 to 1
```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Joe\n";

#if 0 // Don't compile anything starting here
  std::cout << "Bob\n";
  std::cout << "Steve\n";
#endif // until this point

  return 0;
}
```

- NOTE: Macro substitution doesn't occur when a macro identifier is used within the preprocessor command
```
#define FOO 9 // Here's a macro substitution

#ifdef FOO // This FOO does not get replaced with 9 because itâ€™s part of another preprocessor directive
    std::cout << FOO << '\n'; // This FOO gets replaced with 9 because it's part of the normal code
#endif
```

- Directives are resolved before compilation, from top to bottom on a file-by-file basis. They are NOT part of the c++ language and are all in the global scope. This is why we don't indent as to avoid confusion

## 2.11
- **Header Files** (usually ending in .h or .hpp) are used to propogate forward declarations into a cpp .file

- When you #include a file, the content of the file is inserted at the point of inclusion
  - We use angle brackets < > when the code lives in system paths
    - Preprocessor will only serach for directories specified by the `include directories` configuration, this is defaulted to directories that come with your compiler/OS
  - We use quotes "" for own project files in current project directory that we wrote ourselves

- A header file consists of two parts: a header guard and the conents of the header file, which sould be the forward declarations of all the identifiers

- [Diagram of how includes are working in compiler] (https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section1/IncludeHeader.png)

- Avoid putting definitions in header files as to follow the one-defition rule
  - Since if we have two files in the same program include a header file that contains a definition, we will have 2 definitions of that code in the final compiled program
  - There are work around for this with header guards

- Source files should include their paired header

- Do not include .cpp files!
  - Can cause naming collisions between source files
  - Will make it hard to avoid one definition rule (ODR) issues
  - any change make to one cpp file will cause all the others to recompile as well which is slow
  - It isn't conventional

- Why doesn't iostream (and other std packages) have a .h extension?
  - When C++ was first created all headers in standard library ended in .h suffix
  - When they made the jump to using the std namespace, they wanted to keep backwards compatibility with those using the global namespace include
  - So they created a new way to include standard library packages (which simply doesn't have .h extension) which imports to the std namespace

- When including header files relative paths are not recommended and instead you should have a headers folder on the root (at least for big projects)

- Header files may include other header Files

- When you source file include a header file it also gets any other header files that are included by that header (and any header files those include, and so on), these additional header files are called **Transitive Includes**
  - You should generally not rely on contents of headers from transitive includes as implementation of header files is not guarenteed to be the same across versions

- We should order includes to maximize the change that missing includes (in the header file) will be flagged by the compiler as and not rely on transitive includes:
  (1.) The paired header file for this code file (e.g. add.cpp should #include "add.h")
  (2.) Other headers from the same project (e.g. #include "mymath.h")
  (3.) 3rd party library headers (e.g. #include <boost/tuple/tuple.hpp>)
  (4.) Standard library headers (e.g. #include <iostream>)


## 2.12 - Header Guards
- One problem with header files duplicate definitions can be quite common due to transitive inclusion, e.g main.cpp include 2 header files both of which include the <iostream>

- **Header Guards** are preprocessor directives (used to conditionally compile code) that take the following form:
```
#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
#define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE

// your declarations (and certain types of definitions) here

#endif
```

- When header is included the preprocessor will only add it to the translation unit if SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE is not defined (which is what `#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE` is doing)
  - SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE is conventionally full filename of header file in all caps seperated by underscore e.g SQUARE_HPP


- Header guards do not prevent a header from being included once in different code files!
  - This makes sense since when one translation unit is done all of the macros out of scope for the next file
  - This will cause a linker error if you wrote any definitions in your header file (since two different cpp files would have a definition, duplicate definitions)

- The best way to avoid this is to just not have any definitions in your header files, but sometimes it's unavoidable (like user-defined type definitions)

- Modern compilers support a simpler header guard with the `#pragma` directive
  - This does pretty much the same thing as the guard from earlier
  - pragma is not defined in the C++ standard so it's completely compiler dependent, this is why Google prefers to not use it

## 2.13 - How to Design First Program
- The most important and hardest step of programming in planning

- Step 1: Define you goal
  - Express it as a user-facing outcome in one or two sentences
  - e.g. Generate a list of stock recommendations for stocks that have high dividends.

- Step 2: Define requirements
  - This includes both constraints your solution has to abide and capabilities that program must have
  - e.g. "The stock recommendations should leverage historical pricing data.", "The program should produce results within 10 seconds of the user submitting their request", "Needs a testable version within the next 7 days."

- Step 3: Define tools, targets, and backup plan
  - Common questions to ask yourself here are:
    - Defining what target architecture and/or OS your program will run on.
    - Determining what set of tools you will be using.
    - Determining whether you will write your program alone or as part of a team.
    - Defining your testing/feedback/release strategy.
    - Determining how you will back up your code.

- Step 4: Break down hard problems into easy problems
  - This is a **Top Down** method of solving problems where we are constantly breaking complex tasks down into simpler subtasks which individually are easier to solve

  ```
  Letâ€™s say we want to clean our house. Our task hierarchy currently looks like this:

  Clean the house
  Cleaning the entire house is a pretty big task to do in one sitting, so letâ€™s break it into subtasks:

  Clean the house
    Vacuum the carpets
    Clean the bathrooms
    Clean the kitchen
  Thatâ€™s more manageable, as we now have subtasks that we can focus on individually. However, we can break some of these down even further:

  Clean the house
    Vacuum the carpets
    Clean the bathrooms
      Scrub the toilet (yuck!)
      Wash the sink
    Clean the kitchen
      Clear the countertops
      Clean the countertops
      Scrub the sink
      Take out the trash
  Now we have a hierarchy of tasks, none of them particularly hard. By completing each of these relatively manageable sub-items, we can complete the more difficult overall task of cleaning the house.
  ```
  - We can use this in conjuction with **Bottom Up** problem solving where we can easy tasks we already know we need to do (or have already been done) and group them hierarchically

- Step 5: Figure out the sequence of events
  - This may not be exactly linear but in general should follow a clear path

- Implementation Step 1: Outline main function
  - Don't worry about inputs and outputs for the time being, e.g
  ```
  int main()
  {
  //    doBedroomThings();
  //    doBathroomThings();
  //    doBreakfastThings();
  //    doTransportationThings();

      return 0;
  }
  ```

- Implementation Step 2: Implement each function
  - Each function has three steps
    1. Define the function prototype
    2. Write the function
    3. Test the Function
  - If a function is granular enough this should be straightforward
  - Overly complex functions should probably be broken down more (or possible you are doing stuff in the wrong order)
  - Testing is absolutely vital to ensuring you can trust the code you've already written !!

- Implementation Step 3: Final testing
  - Test the whole program and fix shit that doesn't work

- **Keep programs simple to start**
  - This can help prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed and discouraged, start with something you can fs make and build on top of it

- **Add features over time**
  - Once you have a simple program working well, it's much easier to add features, less stressful tbh

- **Focus on one area at a time**
  - If you split your attention you are more likely to forget important details

- **Test each piece of code as you go**
  - This is so you don't get 1,000 compiler errors at once lol, as mentioned earlier trusting the code you wrote is so important !!

- **Don't invest in perfecting early code**
  - If you invest too early in polishing code (documentation, optimization, etc...) you risk losing all that investment when a code change is necessary

- **Optimize for maintainability, not performance**
  - Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth said "premature optimization is the root of all evil"
  - Most performance benefits come from good program structure, using the right tools and capabilities for the problem at hand, and following best practices.
  - Micro-optimization (like finding which of 2 statements is faster) rarely matter ESPECIALLY when buliding the first version of a program
