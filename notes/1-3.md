### Introduction to objects and variables

- **Random Access Memory (RAM)** is the main memory where the application stores values
    - These values be: defined variables & objects, values entered by user, data read in from file or network, etc.
    - In C++ direct access of memory and storing things in addresses is discouraged and instead we acess memory through an **object**

- An **Object** is a region of memory that a value can hold
    - This chunk of memory can hold things like properties  
    - [In C++ functions are not objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43971298/why-is-a-function-not-an-object)

- A **Variable** is simply an object with a name
    - "Although objects in C++ can be unnamed (anonymous), more often we name our objects using an identifier"

- A **Variable Definition** is a special declaration statement that tells our compiler that we want a variable in the program and to save it in memory (Compiler decides between RAM or a CPU register)
    - Like this `int x;`
    - Or if you want to define multiple variables of the same type `int x, y;`
